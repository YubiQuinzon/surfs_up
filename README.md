# Overview of the analysis
Working for W. Avy, we look at temperature trends to see whether their ice cream/surf show will be sustainable throughout the year. To do this, we will be looking at multiple temperature statistics for the months of June and December. This will be accomplished by filtering our sqlite database for the intended information we are looking for, saving the results into a pandas dataframe, and creating a summary statistics for that dataframe.

# Results
<p> Looking at the summary statistics for both June and December, we can see three major points that support the idea of a consistent buisiness for W. Avy's store<p/>
- For the month of June, we can see the average for temperature for June to be arpund 74 degrees, with more than half the entries are over 75 degrees. The higher temperature average supports good business for W. Avy's store.
- This temperature trend for December its mostly consistent with the summary statistics we see with June. The difference is average is 3 degrees lower at 71 degrees. This temperature difference is not significant enough to create any changes within the business pattern. The temperature is still high enough to bring customers.
- Although 6 months apart, the temperatures relatively stay the same. This shows that throughout the year, the sustainability of the shop should remain strong


# Summary
In summary, looking at the results of the two SQLite queries, we can see that the temperatures in Hawaii do not flucuate significant enough to deter customers from surfing and ice cream. The temperatures remain relatively high, proving a great business opprotunity for W. Avy.
